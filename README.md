🌍 Terrorism Data Analysis & Prediction
📌 Overview

This project explores the global impact of terrorism by analyzing 20 years of data and transforming it into interactive visualizations, insights, and predictive models. Since social media is often the first space where news spreads, we use it alongside terrorism datasets to uncover trends, patterns, and risk factors that shape global security.

Our aim is to present complex data in a simple, visual, and predictive format that can be useful for researchers, policymakers, and data enthusiasts alike.

🎯 Research Objective

Analyze terrorism as a global issue through social data.

Summarize two decades of records (1997–2017) into meaningful insights.

Use data visualization + machine learning to identify patterns and predictions.

Build a foundation for data-driven decision-making in policy and research.
